## A Little About me
    My name is Deven. So far my computer experience consists of introductory computer science in my Phyiscs degree as well as some advancement in my skills in my first semeseter in the Computer Science Master's Program here at New Paltz. I've made a webpage with a game on it, a program for manipulating experimental physics data and I also collaborated on a project to make an evolutionary algorithm to make a maze solving AI.
        
    I look forward to learning what this class has to offer as it I can see myself making a variety of websites for all my different hobbies and interests. It would also be nice to find employment possibly creating or maintaing webpages for someone. I hope to gain the skills to make a webpage go live on a selected domain as I feel I may have a decent handle on creating a webpage. The AI elements of this class also seem like they'll be useful for future endeavors.
