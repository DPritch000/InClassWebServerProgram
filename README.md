# Human vs Zombies — Demo Website

This workspace contains a simple 5-page static demo site for a Human vs Zombies game. It's intended as a starting point for a class project.

Files added:
- [index.html](index.html) — Home page

To view the site locally, open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder with a static server (for example `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server`).

If you'd like, I can:
- Add images and assets
- Implement a backend endpoint for the contact form
- Improve visual design and add animations

Let me know which next step you'd like.

## A Little About me
   My name is Deven.\
So far my computer experience consists of introductory computer\
science in my Physics degree as well as some\
advancement in my skills in my first\
semester in the Computer Science Master's\
Program here at New Paltz. I've made a\
webpage with a game on it, a program for\
manipulating experimental physics data and I\
also collaborated on a project to make an\
evolutionary algorithm to make a maze\
solving AI.

I look forward to learning what this class\
has to offer as it I can see myself making a\
variety of websites for all my different\
hobbies and interests. It would also be nice\
to find employment possibly creating or\
maintaining webpages for someone. I hope to\
gain the skills to make a webpage go live on\
a selected domain as I feel I may have a\
decent handle on creating a webpage. The AI\
elements of this class also seem like\
they'll be useful for future endeavors.
